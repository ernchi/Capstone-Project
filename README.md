# Capstone Project

## Project Description
This repo consists of the capstone project my team and I worked on during my final semester in college. 

The goal of our project was to create an AI-powered, dynamically generated text-based adventure game. We used IBM Cloud's Watson Assistant service to facilitate the conversation between the player and AI. For text generation, we used GPT-2 which is a pre-trained language model. 

The game is in the file main_game.py in the AI-Story-Teller folder.
