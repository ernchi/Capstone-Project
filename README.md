# Capstone Project

## Project Description
This repo consists of the capstone project my team and I worked on during my final semester in college. 

The goal of our project was to create an AI-powered, dynamically generated text-based adventure game. We used IBM Cloud's Watson Assistant service to facilitate the conversation between the player and AI. For text generation, we used GPT-2 which is a pre-trained language model. 

The game is in the file main_game.py in the AI-Story-Teller folder. 

## Project Contribution
I contributed to the project by setting up the main structure of the game by creating the basic classes required to run the game. I also worked on the graphical interface of the game map which shows the room the player is currently in and shows the direction the player is currently facing.
