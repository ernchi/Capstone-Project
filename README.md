# Capstone Project

## Introduction
This is the capstone project my team and I worked on during my final semester in college. 

The goal of our project was to create an AI-powered, dynamically generated text-based adventure game. We used IBM Cloud's Watson Assistant service to facilitate the conversation between the player and AI. For text generation, we used GPT-2 which is a pre-trained language model. 

## Quick Start
### Pre-requisites
- Install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install pytorch (https://pytorch.org/)
- Install aitextgen (https://docs.aitextgen.io/)

### Instructions
1. Download the repository into your machine
2. On the command line, go to the AI-Story-Teller directory
3. Run the command `python main_game.py`

## Personal Contributions
- Set up the main structure of the game by creating basic classes required to run the game
- Wrote algorithms for random map generation and player movement
- Created graphical interface of the game map and programmed its features such as: showing which room the player currently is at, showing the direction the player is currently facing, the map automatically updates when the player discovers a new room
